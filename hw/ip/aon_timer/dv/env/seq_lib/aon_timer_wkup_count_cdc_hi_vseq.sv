  // u_wkup_count_hi_cdc CCOV closure task.
  // It's very difficult to close some CCOV for the instance above (including the arbiter)
  // because the counter is 64-bits and is split in two 32-bit half registers which means the
  // 'hi' part of the register won't be counting frequently unless the bottom 32-bits overflow.
  // This task aims to:
  // 1) Disable the wkup_ctrl.enable field at the right time to allow for missing conditional
  //    and branch coverage to be hit in the arbiter (prim_reg_cdc_arb). In particular, the counter
  //    must be disabled exactly at the cycle the 'hi' part of the counter update. This causes
  //    `dst_qs_o != dst_qs_i` which will cause `dst_lat_q=1` and clear all the associated holes.
  // 2) In addition to the above, prim_reg_cdc requires a front-door wkup_count_hi write right after
  //    the counter is disabled in order to achieve the condition `src_update==1 && busy==1`
  //
  // Note: The enabling/disabling as well as some of the write wkup_countr_hi could also be achieved
  //       through front-door accesses. However, it would take longer to close coverage since each
  //       TL access needs to cross the CDC.
